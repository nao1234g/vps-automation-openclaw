## Day 1 (ローンチ日)

### Note 1
Asia is about to become the world's biggest crypto market.

But almost nobody covers it in English.

I just launched AISA — a newsletter tracking crypto regulation across Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

Free weekly reports. Link in bio.

### Note 2
Fun fact: Japan is cutting crypto taxes from 55% to 20%.

That's the biggest tax cut in Japan's crypto history.

Most of you probably didn't know this because it was only reported in Japanese.

That's exactly why AISA exists.

## Day 2

### Note 1
BlackRock just said Asian institutional crypto allocation could unlock $2 TRILLION in inflows.

Not million. Trillion.

Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore are all racing to be the hub.

We're tracking all four. Weekly updates at AISA.

### Note 2
Korea's Upbit regularly outpaces Coinbase in trading volume.

Now Korea is approving spot crypto ETFs.

Korean retail + ETFs = one of the biggest liquidity events in crypto history.

---

## Day 3

### Note 1
Consensus Hong Kong 2026 just ended.

11,000 attendees. 122 countries. The theme? "Machine Economy."

Hong Kong's Chief Executive outlined a plan to make HK the global Web3 hub.

Stablecoin licenses dropping in March.

### Note 2
The difference between HK and Singapore's crypto strategy:

🇭🇰 Hong Kong: "Move fast, regulate smart, attract volume"
🇸🇬 Singapore: "Move slow, build trust, attract institutions"

Both are bullish. Just different timelines.

---

## Day 4

### Note 1
Three Japanese megabanks — MUFG, SMBC, Mizuho — just got approved for yen stablecoin pilots.

Japan is building crypto rails at the banking level.

This isn't speculative. This is infrastructure.

### Note 2
Japan's Finance Minister Katayama stood at the Tokyo Stock Exchange and declared 2026 a "digital year."

Crypto ETF-like products are coming to traditional Japanese exchanges.

Imagine trillions of yen in Japanese savings accounts getting an easy on-ramp to crypto.

---

## Day 5

### Note 1
Most crypto newsletters cover the US and Europe.

But here's the thing: Asia already has more crypto trading volume.

And almost none of their regulatory news reaches English-speaking investors in time.

By the time it hits Crypto Twitter, the alpha is gone.

### Note 2
If you trade crypto and don't monitor Asian regulation, you're flying blind.

AISA tracks:
🇯🇵 Japan FSA
🇰🇷 Korea FSC
🇭🇰 Hong Kong SFC
🇸🇬 Singapore MAS

Daily. In English. Before anyone else.

---

## Day 6

### Note 1
Korea's stablecoin law is being finalized RIGHT NOW.

There's a power struggle between the Bank of Korea and the FSC over who gets to regulate stablecoins.

BOK wins = banks only
FSC wins = fintechs welcome

This decision will shape the entire Korean DeFi market.

### Note 2
Singapore just positioned itself as the "boring but safe" crypto hub.

While Dubai and HK chase retail volume, Singapore wants pension funds, sovereign wealth, and family offices.

Slower money. But much, much bigger money.

---

## Day 7

### Note 1
Week 1 of AISA is in the books.

What we've covered:
🇯🇵 Japan's tax revolution
🇰🇷 Korea's ETF race
🇭🇰 Hong Kong's Web3 ambitions
🇸🇬 Singapore's institutional play

Weekly report drops tomorrow (Monday). Subscribe for free →

### Note 2
One thing I've learned this week:

The language barrier in Asian crypto is the single biggest information asymmetry in the market right now.

If you can read Japanese, Korean, or Chinese, you have an edge.

If you can't, AISA gives you that edge.
