# Introducing AISA: The Only English-Language Newsletter Covering Asia's Crypto Regulation in Real-Time

**Asia is about to become the world's largest crypto market. And nobody is covering it in English.**

---

## Why AISA Exists

BlackRock just said a 1% crypto allocation from Asian institutional portfolios could unlock **$2 trillion in inflows**.

Japan is cutting crypto taxes from 55% to 20%. Korea is approving spot ETFs. Hong Kong just hosted 11,000 people at Consensus 2026. Singapore is building the institutional fortress.

**But here's the problem:** All of this information is published in Japanese, Korean, and Chinese. By the time it reaches English-language crypto Twitter, the alpha is gone.

AISA fixes that.

## This Week's Headlines

### 🇯🇵 Japan: The Tax Revolution
Japan announced a historic shift: crypto taxes dropping from **55% to a flat 20%**, aligning digital assets with stocks and bonds. Three megabanks (MUFG, SMBC, Mizuho) received FSA approval for yen stablecoin pilots. Finance Minister Katayama declared 2026 a "digital year" and plans to bring crypto products to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

**Signal:** Institutional money that avoided Japan due to punitive taxes will start flowing in. Watch JPY stablecoin liquidity pools for early-mover advantage.

### 🇰🇷 South Korea: The ETF Race
Korea's "Digital Asset Phase 2 legislation" is being finalized in Q1 2026. Upbit has publicly stated it's "ready for Bitcoin ETFs." The government included crypto ETFs in its 2026 Economic Growth Strategy.

**Signal:** Korean retail already dominates global crypto volume. Add ETFs = massive liquidity injection. Monitor FSC announcements for timing.

### 🇭🇰🇸🇬 Hong Kong & Singapore: Two Strategies, One Goal
Consensus Hong Kong 2026 just concluded (Feb 10-12) with 11,000 attendees from 122 countries. Hong Kong is issuing stablecoin licenses in March. Singapore reinforced its position as the "boring but safe" institutional hub.

**Signal:** Post-Consensus partnerships will move markets over the next 2-4 weeks.
