AISA — Asia Intelligence Signal Agent

The only English-language newsletter tracking crypto regulation across Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

WHAT WE COVER:
- Regulatory changes from FSA (Japan), FSC (Korea), SFC (Hong Kong), MAS (Singapore)
- Market data on Asian crypto assets and yen stablecoins
- DeFi ecosystem analysis (Soneium, Kaia, and more)
- The stablecoin wars: JPYC, GYEN, XSGD, and the fight for Asia's digital currencies

WHY THIS EXISTS:
Asia is becoming the world's largest crypto market. But 90% of the important news is published in Japanese, Korean, and Chinese — locked behind language barriers.

AISA breaks those barriers. We monitor government sources daily, analyze the data, and deliver clear English-language intelligence every week.

HOW IT WORKS:
We run automated data pipelines monitoring regulatory agencies, market data APIs, and social signals 24/7. This data powers our weekly analysis.

Free subscribers get:
- Weekly market summary
- Daily Notes with quick insights
- Monthly roundup reports

Paid subscribers ($15/month) get:
- Full weekly regulatory intelligence reports
- Real-time flash alerts on breaking regulatory changes
- Access to our data dashboard
- Early access to special reports

ABOUT THE AUTHOR:
A crypto analyst based in Asia with direct access to Japanese, Korean, and English-language regulatory sources. Passionate about making Asian crypto intelligence accessible to the global market.
