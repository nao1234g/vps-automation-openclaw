## Week 2 具体的Notesプリセット（手動投稿用バックアップ）

### Day 8, Note 1
Japan's 3 megabanks — MUFG, SMBC, Mizuho — are all building yen stablecoins.

Combined assets: $7 trillion.

When these launch, JPY stablecoins won't be a niche product. They'll be banking infrastructure.

We broke this down in our Japan report: [link]

### Day 8, Note 2
The global stablecoin market hit $310 billion in December 2025.

Asia is the fastest-growing region: 69% YoY growth in crypto inflows.

But most English-language coverage focuses on USDT vs USDC in the US.

AISA covers the other side: JPY, KRW, SGD, HKD stablecoins.

### Day 9, Note 1
Korea has 10.17 million crypto accounts.

That's roughly 1 in 5 adults.

Yet there's ZERO DeFi regulation.

The Digital Asset Basic Act is stuck in a deadlock between the central bank and financial regulator.

Full breakdown in our Korea report: [link]

### Day 9, Note 2
Singapore just told crypto companies: get licensed or leave.

The DTSP framework (June 2025) requires all digital token service providers to be MAS-licensed.

Catch: MAS won't license companies whose "substantive activity" is outside Singapore.

This is how you filter tourist companies from real builders.

### Day 10, Note 1
Sony's Soneium blockchain already has:
- 47M+ transactions
- 14M active wallets
- Aave, Uniswap v4, Lido

This isn't a "corporate blockchain" experiment.

This is real DeFi activity backed by a $100B company.

Full analysis in our DeFi report: [link]

### Day 10, Note 2
Hong Kong is issuing stablecoin licenses in March 2026.

Beijing just had 8 regulators crack down on crypto.

This is the biggest "one country, two systems" test for crypto ever.

Standard Chartered, Ant Group, and Bank of China all applied.

### Day 11, Note 1
The LINE app has 130 million users across Japan, Korea, Thailand, Indonesia.

LINE's parent company is building a stablecoin super-app on Kaia blockchain.

Imagine if WhatsApp suddenly supported 8 different currency stablecoins.

That's what's happening in Asia right now.

### Day 11, Note 2
Japan's crypto tax cut from 55% to 20% isn't just about traders.

It's about institutions.

No hedge fund was going to set up a Japan crypto desk with a 55% tax rate.

At 20%, Japan becomes competitive with Singapore and Hong Kong.

### Day 12, Note 1
Most people think USDT dominates everywhere.

In Asia, that's true for now.

But every Asian regulator is building walls:
- Japan: must comply with Payment Services Act
- Korea: need a local branch
- Hong Kong: KYC every holder
- Singapore: MAS-regulated only

USDC is better positioned for this regulated future.

### Day 12, Note 2
Asia-Pacific leads the world in RWA tokenization.

$65 billion in TVL as of 2025.

Two government-backed projects driving this:
🇭🇰 Project Ensemble (HKMA)
🇸🇬 Project Guardian (MAS)

This is where TradFi meets DeFi — and Asia is ahead.

### Day 13, Note 1
Korea's stablecoin deadlock explained in 30 seconds:

Bank of Korea: "Only banks can issue stablecoins"
Financial Services Commission: "That kills innovation"
Democratic Party: "We'll pass a law by January 2026"

It's now February. No law yet.

10.17 million crypto users are waiting.

### Day 13, Note 2
Japan's JPYC launched in October 2025 as the first regulated yen stablecoin.

Their target: ¥10 trillion (~$65B) in circulation within 3 years.

Revenue model: no transaction fees. They earn from Japanese Government Bond interest on reserves.

That's a central bank playbook, not a startup playbook.

### Day 14, Note 1
One week of AISA:

We covered:
🇯🇵 Japan's tax revolution
🇰🇷 Korea's stablecoin deadlock
🇭🇰 Hong Kong's licensing surge
🇸🇬 Singapore's institutional play
💰 Asia DeFi ecosystem
🪙 The stablecoin wars

All free. All in English. All backed by automated data.

### Day 14, Note 2
Week 2 of AISA starts now.

Automated pipelines are collecting data from:
- Japan FSA
- Korea FSC
- Hong Kong SFC
- Singapore MAS
- Reddit, CoinDesk, The Block, Decrypt
- CoinGecko, DefiLlama

24/7 monitoring. Weekly human-quality analysis.

This is the future of financial newsletters.
